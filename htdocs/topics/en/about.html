	<h1>About Cramwords</h1>
	
	<p>Cramwords is a non-profit word-learning service in the Internet.</p>
	
	<p>The goal of Cramwords is to suggest an easy-to-use 
	environment that allows everyone to teach and learn 
	foreign words, including general vocabulary, technical 
	terms, slang, and more. With Cramwords each teacher or 
	language school can assemble vocabularies in line with 
	their syllabus and share them with their students.</p>
	
	<p>Cramwords aims to give students not only a word memorization 
	training apparatus but also a tool helping them bring the 
	knowledge into a system. We divide the words into functional 
	groups, and each reflects a particular subject domain or an 
	abstract relation.</p> 
	
	<p>A subject domain is a set of things, properties, 
	and actions possible in the real world. Animals, books, food, 
	and so on are subject domains.</p> 
	
	<p>An abstract relation expresses a speaker's point of view on 
	a subject domain. Say, we can prefer cats to dogs, Shakespeare to 
	Chaucer, or pizza to steak (and vice versa if you like so more!). 
	We can place subjects in space and order actions in time. We can 
	use the exact words to speak about our possibilities, intentions, 
	and duties regarding different subject domains.</p> 
	
	<p>To make a long story short, we divide a vocabulary into mental 
	material and a mental toolbox. The material should be enough for 
	speaker aims, while the toolbox should be full-featured.</p>
	
	<p>We have the following features in Cramwords now.</p>
